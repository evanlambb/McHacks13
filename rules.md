## 🎯 Challenge Overview

You are **elite market makers** with the fastest network connection on the street. Your mission: **develop a trading algorithm that survives market chaos and generates profit under extreme conditions**.

You see market data before anyone else. You can detect crashes forming in milliseconds. You provide liquidity when it matters most. But you also face the greatest risk—your inventory can explode, your spreads can widen, and a flash crash can wipe out your entire position in seconds.

This is high-frequency trading at its most intense.

## 📊 The Game

### Your Objective
```
Build an algorithm that excels across all market conditions.
The best team wins. Period.
```

### What You Control
- **Order submission:** Buy/sell limit orders or market orders
- **Position management:** Adjust inventory, hedge risk
- **Quote adjustment:** Adapt spreads to market conditions
- **Risk discipline:** Stop losses, position limits, inventory caps
- **Speed:** React faster than anyone else to market changes

### Your Competitive Advantage
- **Fastest data feed:** You see market snapshots 100ms before everyone else
- **First-mover advantage:** You can detect crashes and adapt before others react
- **Network efficiency:** Your orders execute with zero latency

### Market Agents
The market is populated with other agents that act on the book like you. Each trade consumes liquidity.
When crashes occur, these agents interact to create cascading effects you must navigate.

## 💡 What Wins

The best market makers excel at:
- **Profitability:** Generate strong returns through smart trading
- **Notional Traded:** Trade actively across all conditions
- **Inventory Management:** Maintain light positions to survive crashes
- **Speed:** React faster than competitors to market changes

One team will dominate all four dimensions. That team wins.

## 🚀 Technical Setup

### Getting Started

The GitHub repository includes:
- **Python template** for connecting to the exchange simulator
- **Market data handler** for receiving real-time feeds
- **Order submission module** for sending trades

The repo will be communicated in the Discord channel.

## 📈 Hackathon Timeline

### Training Phase
Three scenarios will be released representing 15 minutes of market data each.

You can:
- Run them as many times as you wish
- Test different strategies on each scenario
- Dominate all three to prepare for finals

### Finals Format (Last 3 Hours)
One Final scenario will be available 3 hours before the end of the hackathon. It is a full trading day run (6 hours and 30 minutes) - you need to survive it.

**Strategy:** Test your algorithms early. Save your best algorithm for finals.

---

## ⚠️ Rules

### You Can
✅ Use any programming language (Python templates provided)
✅ Use any libraries or AI tools
✅ Submit multiple versions before finals

### You Cannot
❌ Hardcode prices or crashes
❌ Exceed 1 second per decision cycle
❌ Exceed 5000 of inventory shares.

### Finals Rules
❌ One run for the final scenario only

## 🚨 Final Words

> **You have the fastest network and the first-mover advantage. The question is: what will you do with it?**

**Test early. Test often. Save your best for finals.**

The first part is your **training ground**. Iterate, refine, optimize.
